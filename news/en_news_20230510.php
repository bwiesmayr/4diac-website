<p>Dear 4diac community,
</p>

<p>
Every year, Google provides funds to students and beginners of open source to learn about contributing to open source projects. 
We are pleased that two of the proposals submitted for Eclipse 4diac were accepted. 
The projects allow students to concentrate on open source contributions during their summer break, and provide a unique opportunity for projects like Eclipse 4diac to develop prototypes for new features.
</p>

<p>
	Andrea, a second-year computer science student, will work on improving the quality of the IDE. Paul was already a participant of the program in 2022. This year, he will work on providing tools for developers of IEC 61499 applications to ensure their correctness.
</p>

<p>
Two of our committers will serve as mentors for our students. 
Many thanks to Bianca and Michael for introducing Andrea and Paul to our community and providing support. 
</p>

<p>
	Please welcome our contributors for 2023!
</p>
